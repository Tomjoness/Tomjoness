## 💡 About Me

I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. With experience delivering live consulting projects, leading stakeholder engagement, and building practical digital tools, I thrive at the intersection of strategy and technology.

I recently completed a 12-month internship with Boeing, where I worked on system architecture, requirements analysis, and stakeholder communications across major defence and transformation projects. My academic journey has focused on combining technical insight (Power BI, SQL, Python, PHP) with business value — including a dissertation on machine learning and IoT in sport.
